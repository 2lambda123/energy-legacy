## RestKit Integration

Folio uses a custom build of [RestKit 0.9.3](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/tree/0.9.3) , but only the files `NSManagedObject+ActiveRecord.h` and `NSManagedObject+ActiveRecord.m`, this version is 4 years old at the time of writing.

This has been a stable foundation for years, and not one that we have ever had problems with. In keeping with libraries the Apache License we state the [changes](CHANGES.md) made and include all of the original license and copyright notices.
