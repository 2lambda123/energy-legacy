The iPhone and iPad app that brings all the Partners to the yard.

### Docs

Get setup [here](docs/getting_started.md). Further documentation can be found in the [documentation folder](docs#readme).

### OSS Quick Start

Want to get the app running as an OSS project? Run this in your shell:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/artsy/energy.git
cd energy
bundle install
make oss
bundle exec pod install
open "Artsy Folio.xcworkspace"
```

You will have a running version of the Artsy app by hitting `Build > Run`. 

### Work at Artsy?

Instead of `make oss` in the above, run `make artsy` to set up [spacecommander](https://github.com/square/spacecommander).

### Don't work at Artsy?

We're actively looking for more [mobile developers](https://www.artsy.net/job/mobile-engineer) to join our [team](https://github.com/artsy/mobile/). Want work in NYC, and do impactful work in the open? Get in contact.
