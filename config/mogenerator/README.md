Artsy Mogenerator Template
================

Based on Tony Arnold's template, which will be based on Wolf Rensch's template.

This is an extremely minimalized template, as the template files are reduced in readability but the machine generated files are enhanced in readabilty. It's a trade-off that I think is fair as I don't have to maintain the official templates and I will be seeing the generated files a lot more often than the templates.
